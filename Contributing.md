You can contribute to this project in several ways:

 - Reviewing pull requests.
 - Reporting bugs.
 - Propose new feature.
 - Or if your familiar with the project you can work on a new feature.

## Reviewing pull requests /bugs

In our projects there will be pull request waiting to be reviewed to be merged, you can make a review of this pull request to help merge this feature (or bugfix) to do that you'll needto :

 - Check if the pull request is complete with a title indicating what it does exactly
 - install the project and the branch and manually test if the pull request answer the problem it's suppose to.
 - Check the submitted code for any problem in scope (the pull request should only modify files associated with the problem it's trying to fix)
 - Check if the code respect the coding convention fixed for this project (and the PSR in general)
 - Check if the test associated with the PR cover sufficiently the use cases you could encounter.
 If one of this condition is not respected the pull request cannot be merged and you should comment where is the problem, so the author can fix it.
 
 ## Reporting bugs
 
 If you find a bug in our application you're more than welcome to report it, for that you should create a new issue with the tag bug, and write a short title describing it, after that you have to write a description of the bug and where to find it.
 
## Proposing a new feature.
If you find that something crucial for our project is missing you can make a proposition for a new feature, proposition have to be taged as such be clearly Titled and have a clear description of what the feature should be.
Before creating a new proposition you have to be sure that such feature is not already proposed or has already been rejected.
A proposition can be rejected by the product owner if it find it not relevant or not on the scope of the project.
The best way to be sure that a proposition will result in a new feature is to work on it.

## Coding a new feature
If you want to colaborate even more and to use some of your coding skills to our project you can take on accepted proposition and develop the branch .
The coding colaboration aspect is define in page 9 of the user manual.
some important point are.

 - You should respect the coding convention of the project
 - You have to write test that cover the feature you are implementing.
 - the branch must pass the automated test and code climate coverage.
 - you have to only modify code in the scope of the feature
 -  you have to make sure that your feature does not heavely impact the perfomance of the project (by monitoring your performances via a profiler)
